	      <p>Singer-songwriter Joseph Childress started writing and playing music in the mountains of Teller County, Colorado when he was 14 years old. Five years later – inspired by Woody Guthrie’s autobiography Bound For Glory – he strapped his guitar, Mama, to his back and hopped a freight train to see the country. Dubbed a "perennial vagabond" by the San Francisco Bay Guardian, Joseph traveled and toured for two years, hopping trains and living in a van. His wanderings were punctuated only so he could play music, work ranch on the plains of Niobrara County, Wyoming, and rest his head in San Francisco, where he eventually settled down. All the while, his heavily circulated self-released CDr, known to fans as &quot;the Rebirths&quot;, was inspiring devoted listeners in all corners of the country.</p>
	      <p>Joseph’s music draws inspiration from the mountains in which he was raised, the ranch on which he worked, his friends, family, and loves. Compared to Jackson C. Frank, Devendra Banhart, and Bob Dylan (his biggest influence), his emotionally charged voice carries stories of love & travels over guitar playing that ranges from sweet finger picking to furious strumming. He has played shows across the western United States with numerous acts including Devendra Banhart, Joanna Newsom, Richard Buckner, Vetiver, Lavender Diamond, Entrance, David Dondero, Diane Cluck, Kind Of Like Spitting, and many more… and has toured with lovely acts including the Love Letter Band (Bad Weather California), Mariee Sioux, Messes, and Randazzo Robinson.</p>
	      <p>Joseph currently lives in San Francisco in the Sunset district.</p>

	      <p>&quot;These two tracks are stunning examples natural reverb and location specific field recordings. Definitely one of the best singles to be released this year. Gorgeous doesn't begin to explain these recordings.&quot;<br />
	        -- Raven Sings The Blues</p>
	      <p>&quot;To think of these two bands in the middle of nowhere, playing these two amazing tracks to no one but themselves in the middle of the night, choreographing the percussion performance inside that space...it's the saddest thing I can think of. It's genius to record here and adds immeasurably to the ambiance of the recording.&quot;<br />
	        -- 7 Inches</p>
	      <p>&quot;What I like most about these songs is the ghostly feeling that comes from hearing them paired together […] the record is quite like two similar spirits willing their abandoned dwelling to sag upright before poetically keeling over; broken-down new folk songs recorded in an old forgotten well fogging the mirror of this dark, nostalgic time of year.&quot;<br />
	        -- Amoeba Music</p>
	      <p>&quot;Thumps, creaks, giggles, clicks -- these are the first sounds you hear when listening to a recording by Joseph Childress. The California-born, Colorado-bred songwriter doesn't make CDs, per se, but rather lo-fi snapshots taken during his many travels across the continent. Perpetually on the move, Childress packs his lush acoustic lullabies with the wizardry of Devendra Banhart and the earthy innocence of Vashti Bunyan, as heard on his widely circulated demo, dubbed The Rebirths by his fans -- if "fans" is an accurate word. Intimate, otherworldly and hypnotically engaging, Childress makes friends, not followers, with his music. Aside from a bona fide recording session in Denver and his hi-dive date with the Places and A Dog Paloma, Childress will no doubt play a few cozy sets in back yards and on front porches while he's in town. Catch a couple before he up and disappears again.&quot;<br />
